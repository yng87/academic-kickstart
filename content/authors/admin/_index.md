My research area during the graduate course was particle physics phenomenology, in particular astrophysical probe of physics beyond the standard model.
I experienced various mathematical modeling, numerical calculation and national/international collaboration.

Currently I am interested in machine learning application to the computer vision and natural language processing.

I like Julia, Python and C++.
